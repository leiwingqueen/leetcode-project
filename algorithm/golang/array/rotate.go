package array

// Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
//Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
//Explanation:
//rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
//rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
//rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
//Example 2:
//
//Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
//Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
//Explanation:
//rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
//rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= nums.length <= 105
//-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
//0 <= k <= 105
//
//
//Follow up:
//
//Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
//Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
